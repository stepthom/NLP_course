I accept the religious dress code so i was not alowed to enter in shorts. I had to rent an Indian lunghi, male long dress. The guards was not polite, almost unfriendly. One lady guard was about to destroy my expensive camera wich i had to leave outside. Inside the temple it was to follow the marked way. Somwhere you was blessed by some holy man. But everywhere there was stands with different things for sale. Worst was the way out with an enormous market with holy souvenirs of different quality, most kitscy plastic things"" made in China"". The holy experience i had looked forward to have dissapeared in a commercial thing. All they wanted was my money.",2,NEGATIVE

44,Trip Advisor,91Pratyush,3/27/2014,Serenity and divinity packed into one!,"It was a spur of the moment decision to visit ISKCON temple but how glad I am that I made that decision. We reached the temple by 6 pm and so we had an hour to roam around before attending the aarti at 7. We went through the whole charade of security check in and shoes and luggage check in. After going though this, few small temples came on the way and after offering our prayers, we made way to the main temple. At the foot of the main temple, you get two ways. Either you can take the normal and directly make your way to the temple or you can take the other way which has a lot of step like structures in a round-robin manner. You are supposed to take one step at a time and chant ""Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare"". I suggest you go through this charade. You feel great by the time you enter the temple. The temple hall is just beautiful. The wonderful carvings, the peaceful aura and the mesmerizing idols, simply artistic. We waited for the aarti which was divine indeed. Once you exit the hall, you exit through a lane where a lot of stalls have been put up. Its like a mini shopping complex out there. I was shocked at the commercialization of the temple but it's acceptable when you think of all those coming here. In fact, even we ended up buying an idol. All in all, a must visit place, probably in the morning, though the evenings are not bad either.",5,MIXED

One can sit and keep adoring the beauty all day. Te inside of the main temple is breath-taking and stunning. There is however something that I don't like about it is the way it is deliberately given an angle of a shopping center with limitless merchandises that one can buy. It is really commercialized, if you will! Other than which, there is really no ticket to visit the temple. It is located right by the Orion mall so while you are there, it is certainly worth your time unless you are an atheist.

90,Trip Advisor,Abhik G,4/16/2017,Where god meets it's devotees,"Well the title says it all. This place is well barricaded, well maintained by the sevaks/security personnel who in turn guide the devotees to the main temple. Though it feels a little frustrating as you have to walk a long way up to the main temple but as you reach the main temple mere darshan of holy god takes away all your tiredness. I did not liked the way ISKCON is marketing Krishna but it's my personal view. This place is good for people who are able to walk properly and balance themselves as there's a lot of push and pull due to huge crowd gatherings. The free prasadam counter is at a very narrow corner. The temple trustee may rethink of moving it. I have visited the temple more than couple of times but will advise people/bhakts to avoid Sunday's or any special holy day since its overcrowded and it leads to fracas between the temple securities/sevaks who maintain the huge queues and even at the pvt. car entrance. For aged people although they have offered wheel chair service but it will be good if they provide sevaks to push the wheel chairs as well. Overall the experience of visiting this place is heavenly as you enter the garbha gruha or main temple you forget all your complaints,that's the beauty of god.

You will also meet temple priest who will teach you the way to please God. Well everyone has their own definition of God and devotion and so have mine. A good place to be with family without any concern. But you go there.. Do not miss the morning Aarti and the Prasadam they give to all the devotees.

219,Trip Advisor,akshayas83,1/14/2015,Nice place to visit and get calmed,I visited ISKON temple after long time (may be 2-3 years gap) and realized that nothing much changed over the time. Gone with spouse taking my 2 years daughter over the bike entered premises and seen for parking they started charging 10 rupees which was not there previously but they have good parking facility so not a issue over parking space. Gone through normal line which takes through tiles where peoples are chanting while placing a foot on tiles. (If you pay more you don't need to chant go can go directly for darshan (which I don't like it really). On the way took fruit basket for offering and I been asked for 300 rupees for different lane which will take people closure to the idols when I refused fruit basket was taken from me and sent me forward (it kept side & doubt it might gone back for sell) but later I got the broken coconut and bananas so no complain about taking fruit basket and keeping aside intact. Going back realized that return path is changed and now return path is all full off marketing and it tempting to buy some items on the way & last stop is eatery. Going out you will be given prasadam (this time it was banana) and just outside there small restaurant where someone have nice meal. its good place to visit and shed some worries (other things I mentioned it was my perspective not everybody will agree for it).,4,MIXED

I paid 300rupee for the tourist / ""fast track"" path around the property which was worth it for me as I could not stay for too long (you have to follow a set one-way path around the grounds). Really enjoyed the market attached at the back of the temple where you could buy delicious sweets for 10rupees apiece (not sure of the names but pretty sure samosas and gulab jamun was there), all sorts of souvenirs, clothing items & religious literature. The temple also provided visitors with a free bite to eat, some rice soup cooked in line with sattvic principles which was delicious. A very interesting and enjoyable visit.

Its huge and architecturally a great structure, well planned and executed. Old people with knee problems should give it a miss as the number of steps are too many but that is purely due to the hilly nature and crowd management. Everything is systematic, right from depositing your shoes, hand wash and crowd management is awesome till the main temple area.(Though I didn't like the chanting on each step). Once the darshan is completed, now starts the real fun, chaos and mis-management. The temple suddenly turns into a food court, shopping mall, selling you t-shirts, paintings, souvenirs and snacks. Sometimes you find people loitering on the floors making it difficult for you to walk and food crumbles attracting flies and ants. A complete mis-management here.

All the people there are very helpful. One thing which I did not like there is- its too much commercialised. Once you come out of the darshan, there are people at every step trying to sell music, books, etc to you. They literally drag tou to the 'dhyaan' area for meditation giving you a mala in hand and forcing you to chant the mantra. This shouldn't be done by them.

The sheer size and vastness of the complex takes your breath away. As you move upwards from one level to the other you are absorbed in the magnificence of the place. Of course the opulence of the temple at the highest level ( which houses the main deities ) is something to take away for a life time. The ambiance is very elegant and graceful, but the crowd presence in large numbers, kills the serenity of the place. One apparent and slightly disappointing aspect of the place is that at every spot ( waiting halls, passages leading to the temples, prasad hall, .. . ) there is a visible attempt to market the products and other offerings from the ISKCON establishment. At a place of worship a very open and slightly overdone display of this type of marketing - is a little uncalled for. Overall, a place one must visit if it Bangalore.",4,POSITIVE

370,Facebook,Animesh Jain,6/28/2017,NA,Hare Hare!! ISKCON Rajajinagar one of the finest designed temples. The ceiling carved with pictures of Krishna are very pleasing to eyes. The main temple sanctum has high positive energy and vibes. We as a society lack self discipline and that creates chaos in the temple. The guards have to run around to stop people from photographing. The only thing which I don't prefer in a place of worship is commercial sales. One can definitely provide religious literature and books in and around the temple but selling merchandise on multiple counters like market doesn't go well within the temple. There can be a dedicated area for these commercial activities. People who go to visit temple must be given direct entry and exit without forcing them go through all these sales counters.

The walkways leading to the temple are all in rows - very unlikely there'd be a stampede (god forbid), something that is so common with our temples. The temple area inside, and the surroundings are all neat and clean, something that I was delighted to see, personally. Even the prasadam served and the mini food court - all serve tasty food at reasonable prices. There are a lot of religious text available inside in various languages.

The entire place literally transports you to a different world, full of devotion and reflection. The entire temple complex would need to be consumed through your eyes, mind and spirit, and this would need plenty of time, patience, bhakti and energy. The main prayer hall is huge and is an experience to sit through bhajans and/or pooja performances. Books, trinkets, take aways, and a myriad other Krshna products along with the rosaries and the prasadam can well be very good souvenirs for posterity. There are lots of shops selling t shirts to pens to food and one could pay attention to how they relate to the KRSHNA Consciousness and purchase accordingly. It can be quite annoying if someone is not ready, when volunteers seek donation for their several food schemes. If you have the time, just as you step out, you may seek to visit their Akshaya Patra operations area to see the massive meal scheme they run to feed millions of children. Amazing work!

The can be a little too busy and the architecture may not appeal everyone but once you are inside it doesn't take music to take hold of you, energize and refresh you. That is how I felt. To put the things in perspective ...let me mention here that I am not a very religious person and not a follower of ISKON. I felt a sense of peace when I visited the inner hall and attended Arti. Good idea to pay the amount to be part of a specialized Pooja specially if you happen to go there on a crowded day. That way you get to be closer to the idols and get prasadam to carry, along with books worth Rs. 70. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r268431918-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",5,POSITIVE

554,Trip Advisor,Ash-Hash,3/1/2015,"Clean and Good atmosphere, but not the typical southindian Temple!","ISCON is one of the most well maintained temples of south India. Unlike all other famous temples, which has got a great per-historic connection, ISCON doesn't seems to have any. Iscon foundation deals with great charity services, like food for the school kids, who belongs to poor background across the world! This is one of the main reasons, people love Iscon, in spite of the the fact that temple look very commercialized! Location Advantage: Iscon is located in a part of Bangalore which is well developed, its recommended to visit Orion Mall, Not far from the city railway station/Bus station (and also the upcoming metro terminal). Structure: The entire iscon area is not Green, but completely paved with concrete , granite and marble. Iscon temple is on top of a small hill and hence, if we are going there by public transport (bus), then we have to climb the steps. But if we are on our private vehicles, we can go there with an entry pass (parking), to the top to avoid the climbing. Inside the Temple: Most of the time, there will be a long queue (minimum length of 0.5 Km), until we reach the shrine. The same Queue shall be followed to come out of the temple. The queue to the exit is totally commercialized, making the disciples and visitors walk a longer way until they come out of the temple. All this far, we have options to buy Goodies, sweets, Ayurvedic stuffs, and other souvenirs. The disciples and priests are well behaved and down to earth people, which is one point to be noted. Note: - Mobile phones with Camera and Cameras are not allowed inside the temple. There is also Frisking as in airport where we need to even declare these items. Cameras can be surrendered with a nominal fees, and can be taken back on returning. (please remember to collect these items on your way back) Iscon is worth visiting once, unless you are a disciple of ISCON.",3,MIXED

559,Trip Advisor,Ashish N,2/9/2017,Nice place to unwind,"We visit frequently this temple and is generally crowded, given the huge fan following this temple has build up over the years.On weekend, it gets especially crowded and Saturday evening can be slight nightmare if you come with your car as getting a parking lot can be an herculean task. Taking metro can be an option now but then depends on your starting location.if you are coming with elderly people or people with disability, they have a special lift to take you close to the main temple, circumventing the long queue (but would request not to find loophole and misuse this facility).The main sanctum is amazingly decorated and one can spend hours in this place. Best way to spend sometime here, is to move away from the main darshan space and occupy the main courtyard, from where you can get a good view of the gods and also won't be pushed away by the security and temple authority. The way out of the temple has lots of art work and also the eating place (my favorite). If you are going with elderly people and kids, ensure all are moving together as the huge crowd can scatter your family members.

It also wasn't during the festive season, so it was not very crowded. Quite a bit of walk is involved as the temple complex is quite huge. The Hare Krishna chanting in the temple is pleasant. Food (like eggless cakes, savouries and sweets) is awesome inside the complex and is sold at very reasonable rates (other than the 'prasadam' which is of course offered free to all devotees).

Thousand of people are swarming over a place where they are treated as cattles (not surprisingly most of them deserved to be treated like that as in spite of strict instructions to keep moving they keep on standing at one place and gawking over the idols). But it does not give any right to the management to force us through entire shopping area without giving any choice. It's like hou are being punished to come to this place or not believing people who warned you against this behaviour. I know people managing these places have no more interest in deity than ensuring their heavy pockets but still be they can afford to be courteous enough to make it look little more like a temple than a shopping complex.,2,NEGATIVE

Coming to the temple it is a very maintained divine place that looks posh. There is concept that every person visiting this temple will have to say or at least to listen before proceeding to next step a mantra. This is repeated for 108 times and feels good. Once you reach the temple shrine the Idols are decorated beautifully and gives a divine feeling. When you start to decent there are shopping stalls to buy devotional items at the end of which you will find food court as well. There is even a small theater that runs 3D show of little krishna for kids especially. On the whole it is a modern age architecture that combined a Temple and mall together.,5,MIXED

I have seen a few Birla Mandirs and the Swamynarayan Temple at Ahmedabad - two examples that came to mind, which are clean, orderly and peaceful with very little evidence of the importance of money. But if you look at the other reviews here, you will notice that they too have felt it is a commercial place like a mall, or a place of entertainment where you can also buy things. Somehow, every religion seems to popularize the notion that spending your money at places of worship is of paramount importance to reinforce your spirituality.

When you enter the bhajan hall, you will get a amazing feel. all will be in prayers. Securities will push you before you pay or see lord Krishna. I could see the people who came in 100 rupees pass, the priests treating then royally, for others securities treated like slaves. The temple has big canteen, they provide 3 time free food. Also they has big bakery inside the temple, so you can buy sweets from there. The best time to visit the temple is morning 5-30 to 7.30",5,POSITIVE

The premises absolutely neat and clean with staff maintaining the standards continuously. The worship place may appear a bit crowded but he people maintained order and silence. The main altar was in a well illuminated and a decorated hall which had big beautiful paintings drawn on the walls and the ceiling. The idol of Lord Radha Krishna was mesmerizing people sit a while after the Darshan for chanting the slokhas. With the Mangala Arthi starting at 4 am there are many pujas conducted during the day and the Shayana arthi being the last ritual of the day at 8pm. From the temple one can see the spectacular view of the surrounding landscapes and buildings of the city.

I was not disappointed. I came in late afternoon. After a long and quiet queue, I entered the temple with hundreds of faithfuls. The temple is a mix between a rather modern and tradition style. Though it was rather busy with visitors, I could feel the peacefulness of the temple with the chant and smell of incents. I stayed in the main hall to do a meditation as well as observing other visitors. On the way out, I was rather surprised on the numbers of things to sell for visitors. None could resist the temptation to buy something. Though I normally I don't buy things, but I was so much tempted to try some sweets and delicacies. Most of them are way to sweet for me. My suggestion is really to find the one that suits you well. At the end of the visit, each visitor will get free food in a small cup (it's dal in a dried leaf bowl).",4,POSITIVE

If you are lucky, you can sit a bit and meditate. However, one does get a bit hungry after standing in the long line (an orderly line, but long) for darshan. There's great spread of food as soon as step out after darshan and the food is reasonably priced. Everything tastes great: lemon rice, malpua, pakodas. Yum! My favorite is the eggless wheat and jaggery cake. It is divine. There's also a restaurant within the campus and the price in the al-a-carte menu are quite reasonable. If you choose to attack the buffet spread, ensure you have a big stomach and deep pockets. The buffet offers many dishes but it also comes at a steep price.",5,POSITIVE

825,Trip Advisor,CA_AkshayJ,4/28/2017,Serene Temple with a splendid view,"This is a definite not to be missed place in Bangalore. The temple is not only well maintained but also well organised. Also you wont have any problems of any sort of request for offerings from the priests. They are well prepared if there is a rush. There is a big space allocated for keeping shoes and belongings. However if girls are going sleeveless then they will have to purchase/rent a shawl type stole, since the dress code is strict. Once you are inside the temple, taking of photographs is prohibited. Before entering the main temple of Krishna, you will be visiting the smaller temples of Shri Narasimha and Shri Venkatesh. Before entering the main temple, do look around from the top since the view is splendid (if you during a festival you might see fireworks which are awesome). The view is comparable to that of Birla Mandir in Hyderabad. Inside the temple there is a big hall with very nice paintings/carvings on the roof. The main temple has three chambers of deities. Everything is well managed and the Darshan is in a linear fashion. After the darshan in a line, you can sit in the specified place in front of the main chambers. Thereafter you will be going out the exit with various stalls of religious books and the volunteers will enlighten you on their programs if you are interested to go forward with it. After the exit downwards, you will get various shops of things to buy or eat. Thereafter before going to the fountain area you will get Prasadam. You can take a few pics in the fountain area where from the main temple is in view. After wards you can exit and at the exit there is a restaurant if you would like to eat. Bonus tip : One of the best malls of Bangalore is also nearby - Orion Mall - It has got everything in a mall (even Starbucks) and at the backside is a small artificial lake and am phi theater, sometimes musical fountain with lights is also there.

Funny thing with the bazaar-like halls after the main chamber, offering all you can imagine from books over hand-cut figurines, to t-shirts and even animated Krishna DVDs, introducing the belief to children.

As I was with an Indian he has advised me to leave the shoe on the car since the temple does not enter the shoe and nothing that can take pictures. There is some segregation status because it was not necessary to go together with the Indians, many wearing traditional costume. I made a way, I would say more VIP. Until you reach the main temple, small temples. In the main temple also had certain privileges and was already ahead of the temple, where along with a person of the temple made me say the mantra Hare Krishna, as a blessing and good vibes. after that, stay in front of the temple sitting there is a certain ritual with Indian and Hare Krishnas, very interesting.

When we got there we were told what the entry fee was and we were sold a ticket that looks like it was a ticket that allowed us to fast track through the temple (avoiding the queues).

Although a temple, its not limited to spirituality in the presence and worship of the idols. There is a well maintained library section, food and beverage section, shopping section with accessories, ethnic wear, wall decor, interior decor, etc etc etc. It even has a restaurant! i had an incredible transition from feeling peaceful and spiritual (in presence of the idols) to being consumer conscious (happens only when shopping) to being enlightened (library) to being satisfied (hunger satisfied at the fnb section). To sum it all up its definitely worth a visit if you keep an open mind and enjoy every change in emotion while soaking in the experience and ambience of this place. Please avoid holidays and weekends, if you are uncomfortable(like me) amongst a crowd. Also, keep in mind, its a very different temple from the usual south indian temples in terms of ambience and spiritual experience.",4,POSITIVE

They try to sell everything and anything in the name of GOD which felt like a WRONG NUMBER. We were not allowed to the FRONT of the idols as we were not MEMBERS OF ISKCON and neither had we bought the SPECIAL POOJA THAALI for 350/600/1100 etc etc. So much in the name of god. He is Krishna.

The place is no doubt too huge, well-maintained and calm. But what surprised me was the big display board with the prices for some offerings or prayers, the loooong queue which we could happily escape by entering from in-between through some influence which my friend had and most importantly the exit way in the building which is filled with shops selling eateries, books, CDs and other stuffs. One might feel that all the things I mentioned above will be there in most of the temples, why exaggerate for ISKCON, again, it's what I felt when I visited and purely my opinion. So you might or might not feel this as commercialized temple. The God's idol/statute is not in the south-Indian style but is that of North-Indian style, i.e, the white idols. The hall is huge and nice. One thing that you shouldn't miss when you go to this place is to have food at 'Higher Taste'.

It's calm, peaceful and colossal, built on a small hill. It's a worth visiting place for a new comer or traveler visiting Bangalore. One may find queues during festivals and holidays. Car parking is available inside temple premises and there is dedicated place for keeping the shoes. One who may wish, can take a path chanting Hare Krishna Hare Ram (devotees direct you once you enter) or directly walk up. There are two smaller temples on the way to the main temple. The architecture is mesmerizing and the idols look gorgeous. The Sanctum Sanctorum is tranquil and soothing to mind and body. You will find devotees selling books, as you move along the exit. The exit passage takes you to the food court and you can purchase prasad along the way. They also distribute khichdi as prasad. The place is best visited during early mornings and evenings. Darshan Timings: 4:15 am to 5:00 am; 7:15 am to 1:00 pm; 4:00 pm to 8:20 pm. Clicking photos is allowed outside the temple in the campus but not inside the temple.",5,POSITIVE

A lot of money has been spent on the architecture and decorations. Still a good place to visit for once to get an experience of how things go around in temples like these.",2,NEGATIVE
1099,Trip Advisor,Divya S,7/5/2017,Serenity amidst a bustling city,"ISKCON at Bangalore is like a haven of peace and piety, amidst the hustle and bustle of a busy cosmopolitan city. The air itself calls out 'Krishna', even if the taped chants of 'Hare Krishna' weren't played at a loop. The first thing that strikes one about the temple, is the breathtaking majesty of its facade - this is one of the most beautifully designed Krishna temples ever! Situated high above a hill, so be prepared for climbing stairs, the Temple itself commands a panoramic view of the city, from the right side of the sanctum area. Remember the dress code and wear covered clothes - I was in a short sleeved dress, so wore long pajamas underneath to cover up. Also check the temple's timings before you go, it closes during the afternoon. There are toilet facilities (a bit better than primitive) that can be used if there is an absolute need to go. Shoes can be checked in at the shoe racks (hold your nose though, because that area smells of feet!), but to me, the best part is the luggage counter, because you can visit the temple and then go straight to the airport/railway station if you're so minded. There are a 108 steps that one is advised to stop at and chant the complete 'Hare Krishna' mantra for awakening inner consciousness and focusing on Krishna. Two smaller sanctums devoted to 'Prahalada' and 'Prabhupada', lead you on to the majestic main sanctum, which is done up in gold and will elicit an audible wow from most first timers. Onwards from the 'darshan', and there is a book counter, and the exit ways lead to other halls where one can purchase jaap maalas (Hindu rosaries), crystal trees, incense and essential oils, and a whole lot of other things besides. There is a lovely bakery too, and a proper Cafe, aptly names 'The Higher Consciousness'. Free prasadam that's basically made of sweetened tapioca pearls, and you can then take your leave, or stay for longer. It took me about an hour, at a rush, including the 108 chants, so perhaps one would be better advised to keep aside atleast a couple of hours for this beautiful sanctuary of inner consciousness. Hari bol!",5,POSITIVE

1111,Trip Advisor,DolphinD,3/31/2013,"Wonderful experience, enjoyed by a non-devotee","On a visit to Bangalore a colleague offered to take me to ""ISTKON"" which I had never heard of so I went with no idea what to expect. If you are a visitor to India I do suggest hiring a reliable driver even if it's just the cab driver you've already ridden with, as leaving this place is could be a potential nightmare of confusion, as other reviewers have claimed. I am not a person who meditates, and had I known this was a Hare Kishna temple before I arrived, I might not have agreed to go. But immediately upon arrival I was so moved by the beauty of this temple, which increased as we moved up the many steps through various stages of ritual and observations, that I was completely captivated (in the good sense of the word). At every step it's a rather busy and bustling place, but at the top I chose to sit down on the floor, close my eyes, and try to be silent and still my mind. Suddenly about twenty minutes later my host lightly tapped me on the shoulder and suggested it might be time for us to start heading back. Those twenty minutes for me had flown by in an instant. I think I could have sat there another hour or two, and again, I am NOT someone who would normally do that. I would definitely go back, as there is plenty to see along the way up -- beautiful carvings and monumental architecture. And on leaving, we were handed a portion of rice spiced with some amazing combination of spices that I wish I could duplicate at home. I suspect it was cardomam, cinnamon and maybe cloves, but alas, I have been unable to replicate it at home. Until you have visited it is hard to really describe the magic of this place.

On a Sunny day this could be a tad tiring. To start with, they have a very good arrangement of securing your slippers in. You can also opt for a locker where you can secure your valuables though i prefer not to carry any except a mobile phone (which is almost a body part these days) which also needs to be secured in a locker. You have to climb some steps to reach the top of the hill, where main abode, the hall for Krishna temple, Bhajans and meditation are all there. The first feeling is like a WOW!!! You can feel the bliss and the energy of all like minded people doing one thing - Praying and some trying to connect to inner self. Few things you will notice here are the cleanliness, greenery are outstanding. I think they truly believe cleanliness is next to godliness. Don't forget to collect the Prasadams on your way out. There are few shops on your way out, which sell a lot of literature about Lord Krishna and more. A few more shops for other religious and fancy purchases. A Very Godly Service they provide is through the Akshayapatra Foundation - I have been myself part of some Akshayapatra Service through CSR in my company and cant tell you how Fulfilling it is to see the free mid-day meal service being served to deserving kids across India.

1186,Trip Advisor,Fred S,3/26/2016,Religie ontmoet commercie,"Van de tempels die ik bezocht heb was dit verreweg de grootste. Ik was er op goede vrijdag, een vrije dag in India en de belangstelling was overweldigend. Met zijn vieren konden we voor 1000 roepies een VIP pas kopen. Daarmee heb je met maximaal 6 personen toegang tot de hele tempel en word je om de rijen heen geleid. En rijen waren er. Na twee kleinere tempels kom je terecht in wat ik de hoofdtempel zou noemen. Wie in de rij gestaan heeft is nu eindelijk bij zijn doel aangekomen. Wij werden verwezen naar een wachtruimte en verzocht te gaan zitten. Uiteindelijk stonden we vlak voor het altaar. Priesters voerden daar een ritueel op en daarna kregen we een bloem voor achter het oor. Ondanks dat ik weinig van de religie weet een indrukwekkende ervaring. Minder vond ik wat daarna kwam. Niet de uitleg van wat Hare Krishna nu inhoudt, maar wel de enorme hoeveelheid stands met Merchandise. Menig professionele voetbalclub zou er wat van kunnen leren. Zelf ben ik nog opgevoed met het beeld van Jezus die de handelaren de tempel uit sloeg... De opbrengst schijnt wel naar een goed doel te gaan. Maar de ""gemiddeld"" is er een uitvloeisel van. Al met al toch wel een spirituele ervaring. Wel was ik blij met het advies van onze chauffeur om de schoenen vast in de auto te laten. Voor mijn gevoel scheelde dat een hoop gedoe na afloop.",3,POSITIVE

1251,Trip Advisor,George H,1/20/2016,Lacking in spirituality.,"I visited this large temple complex devoted to Krishna within the city centre. No cameras are allowed to be used but you can use your mobile to take photos. Footwear must be removed before entering the temple area. There are quite a number of steps to climb before reaching the main worshipping area. The temple is very clean and neat. It appears to be a fairly new temple compared to others I visited and according to my guide, is supported by donations worldwide. I have to say that although it was a large complex I wasn't impressed either by the inside or the out. I was left with the impression that it was more of a business venture rather than a spiritual one; but still worth a visit even just for the photo opportunity.",3,MIXED

There is no photography allowed in the temple, although I did see people using cellphone cameras. The temple itself (inside) is quite ornate with a lot of gold decorations, but it is not old. What spoils the visit for many is the fact that in order to leave the visitor is forced to snake past many food counters, book sellers and souvenir sellers. For those who wish, or need, a free bowl of dal is offered very near the exit. Leave your shoes in the car or check them, as you must visit barefoot. There is parking on site.",4,NEGATIVE

In a way it was, with entry fees for paid darshan being Rs 500 for a family etc, but it is really ones choice. A lot of people have different reasons to go to temple. Most of them visit temples to get some peace of mind. And truly when you stand in front of the idols, you remain awestruck for a few moments, and then the divine energy pulls you in. It is by far one of the marvellous temples in India, beautifully constructed, well placed, and has everything in place to the comfort of bhaktas.

You have to deposit your shoes and your camera before entering the temple where photography is forbidden. (The photos from the inside of the temple on TripAdvisor must have broken this rule). As a fast-track visitor you get right up to the centre altar and receive some petals to give to the monks who say a blessing while spreading them on the altar.

There canteen is also vast and has a variety of affordable tasty edible items. You can also get CDs with animated Krishna stories for your children.

1347,Trip Advisor,gurubht,3/13/2015,ISKON Hare Krishna Temple - a must visit even for non-believers,"ISKON Hare Krishna Temple is a magnificent, modern, yet ancient looking, intricately designed temple, with the main deity being Lord Sri Radha Krishna. It is not only a temple of many deities, but also a charitable institute and a cultural center. The other main deities are Krishna Balarama, Nitai Gauranga, Srinivasa Govinda and Prahlada Narasimha! One can read about the stories about these deities that easily takes you to the Satyayuga and Dwapara Yuga. The decoration of the statue is intricately done and looks most beautiful. Even non-believers may turn into believers on seeing the smiling Lord Krishna with Goddess Radha. ISKON Bangalore ""Akshaya-Patra"" program supports several 100's of schools around Bangalore city and rural areas with sumptuous, nutrition rich, hot, freshly cooked afternoon meals. Their kitchen is massive and for 1000's of kids! You may please donate for this cause. ISKON also supports Gow-Rasha (Cow Protection) and has Gow-Shalas... ISKON also provides used clothes, but in good condition, to many destitute and poor people. If you have any used clothes (not torn and stained) in good condition, please donate them to ISKON, Bangalore. If you are a Bangalorean, a weekly visit is a must to this temple.",5,POSITIVE

1351,Trip Advisor,guruprasad d,1/25/2017,Hare Krishna!,"Its a privilege to write a review on ISKCON Temple, Bangalore. I had been here for at least 5 times by now. Love this temple a lot. ISKCON is very far from where I am staying, but it is the beauty of the temple which made me visit so many times. The temple is located on a hill and this is clearly visible from the entry gate itself. It is a very big temple. There is a barricade at the entrance of the temple where we must stand in a queue to enter the main gate. From there, we climb up some slope. After climbing, a counter will be there where we have to deposit our mobiles and slippers. Once we do, we move on. Here starts the queue. It is very long, we climb the steps and move on. There is greenery to the left hand side where we go in the queue. Inside the temple, firstly we shall have darshan of ""Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy"". The statutes are built very beautifully. Secondly, darshan of ""Sri Venkateshwara Swamy"" will be done. Again, the beauty of the deity is not to be missed. Finally, we reach the mandir of ""Lord Sri Krishna"" which is on the top. Awesome design, the crowd, the silence, charisma of Lord Sri Krishna will surely attract any tourist. Lord Krishna will appear in 3 screens, the middle one being Radha and Krishna. Whenever I come to ISKCON, I will surely sit and meditate here for at least 15 minutes. Once darshan is done, we move on to shopping arcade. Before that, there is a screen which shows how our soul moves in different bodies (child, adult, married man, old man, etc). There is huge shopping arcade as well as eatery. After shopping, we can find the place where we can have free meals. Also, there is a fountain where we can have a photo shoot or sit for some time and chit chat. We move on to collect our belongings (mobile, slippers) and disperse and REVISIT.",5,POSITIVE

1362,Trip Advisor,HalakBaroda,6/7/2016,Not worth the time.,"The place is grossly over hyped - from both tourist and spirituality point of view. If you have limited time in Bangalore than better not to prioritize it. As it is, Bangalore traffic takes up a lot of travel time and then the temple security and formality have to be complied with. Even when not crowded, the compulsion to repeat the mantra at every step before entering the darshan hall creates slow moving queues without adding any spiritual value. (Can any enforced experience ever be spiritual ? ) After all this ,the architecture and art aren't extraordinary. The main darshan hall does have lovely golden decor and beautifully painted ceiling but then so do most big temples, along with better gardens, carving, history and less hassle. The exit is a long ,winding route through a "" big bazaar"" of religious items , books and a huge ( and yummy ) variety of food counters. There are even posters offering combo offers and discounts on various pujas ! Nope. Not my cup of tea. For peace of mind , the peaceful Isckon temple in my own city is better, thank you. For tourism , there are other , better places in Bangalore.",2,NEGATIVE

Cleanliness is seen every where in the temple which takes it close to godliness. The view of god from the big doors makes you feel the darshan realistic and decoration of the idol is beyond words.

What I did not like is a bit overdose of commercialization, starting from centrum itself, where books are sold and then a pass through eatery and outlets selling other stuff and everyone mandatorily needs to go through these. There should be an exit, which should allow devotees an option to move out without going through the market. Also, the book shop in the main temple should be relocated to one of the lower floors. Early morning or early after noon?s are good time to avoid rush. Temple also has facility for speedy darshan by buying a puja coupon. I normally take this, and it provide place to seat in from of deities and do puja. Good car parking facilities. It also has a restaurant which serves pure veg food. Also has rooms to stay but I never stayed there.",4,MIXED

Situated on the top of a hill you get there by climbing up the steps from the street. The facility is also super friendly to people with limited access - they have wheel chairs and ramps and will also take pains to ensure that people in wheel chairs get a good darshan.

Generally people visit the temple to get the blessings of Lord hence temple ambiance, architecture plays a crucial role. The Lord Venketeshwara and Lord Krisha is simply great, you cannot take eyes and mind out of them. But once you finish your darshan, you are forced to pass through the market, where everything is sold! Innovative shop keepers, even some priests who lures you to sponsor for many of their schemes takes you to different market world. The Bhakthi & peace is lost! Once you come out you never feel that you went to a temple, so powerful is the ISKCON market.

A large complex built in the Dravidian style, this temple sees a heavy rush from devotees particularly on weekends and during festivals, hence, one needs to plan to spend time before going. The temple has beautiful fountains and carvings. The idols are all well-crafted (refer to the pics of the same on their website). There are also food stalls, book stores and stalls for devotional items, as common with other ISKCON temples. The prasadam is extremely tasty and hygienic. The temple is kept clean by the volunteers.

You also have to be bare foot when walking around the grounds, you cannot take photos unfortunately & WARNING - make sure you wear trousers, otherwise you have to wear a ""towel"" like garment before you enter the grounds.

The views of the city from the climb to the temple were very nice. The visit is a self-guided tour with signs explaining various areas, beliefs, rituals, etc. of the Krishna belief. We went in a Sunday night. I think I remember it is open until 8:30pm on Sun. This was a good time to go, as there were not many locals there and basically no tourists. Also, it is cooler at night than during the day. The views of the city at night were also nice. Although entry is free, if one is a foreigner, they try to get you to pay (around $12US) for the ""short-cut"" line. This might be worth it when there are lots of people there, but I have been told even it can be very crowded. Once in either the long or short line, one must remove and leave their shoes in a bag for pick up afterward. This cost a few rupees. There are also other points along the way requiring, or urging additional fees. All told, including if one pays for the short-cut, maybe $25-$30US).

The temples were unique of course and beautifully designed and executed. I am still figuring out the best ways to appreciate Hindu temples due to the complexity of the faith and how the multiple deities interact, but it was beautiful. The most impact-full part however was learning about and getting to tour one of the kitchens of Akshaya Patra, a foundation that provides a mid day meal to over 1.5 million Indian school children a year. Their mission history and the thought they have put into their large kitchens with gravity fed rice cookers that can serve 1,000 and specially designed trucks to carry pots of food to schools within a 45 mile radius was so impressive.

He saw crores of Hindu Bangali of Bangladesh will lose everything and will take shelter in Nadia district of West Bengal and other parts of West Bengal and India and they will be landless, penniless and just like beggars. So, to appease those refugees he decided to take incarnation as sanyasi so that those poor refugees accept his path and become happy. So, all landless refugees will accept Vaishnavism dharma and in performing that dharma, refugees will feel themselves happy and satisfied because rituals, rules and regulations of this dharma will be similar to the condition of their life style. Thus, Lord Vishnu tried to solve refugee problem.God can foresee everything going to happen, so he could see arrival of Britishers in India, their rule, division of India, generation of refugee and fertile area for spreading of Vaishnav dharma. Mayapur was the fertile area because he knew that refugees will assemble around Mayapur area and refugees will be so poor that their life style will be similar to that of a Vaishnav.

For the first time when i went there i was excited and blindly devoted because i have always loved to visit temples , the peace that i get in the chanting of manthras and the smell of Agarbathis and Camphor and not to leave behind the very structures of the idols and the temples have mesmerized me and continue to do so. now coming to Iskcon. The whole of Iskcon temple is like a MALL meant for shopping and looking around. The priests look and talk like they have everyday meeting with Lord Krishna and only they are the rightful devotees of Krishna. Apart from that they treat you like school kids with discipline routines like chanting while getting into the temple. The idols within Iskcon are like showcase material and i would not recommend anyone who is expecting a peaceful retreat of a temple at this complex. Good luck",1,NEGATIVE

One has option, not to take this route as there is another route to the sanctum without these steps.

1855,Google + HK HILL,Krishnaa0205,9/11/2016,"Amazing, awe-inspiring, humbling Temple, the architecture, the location, fountains, view etc","ISKCON Temple: It is one of the most popular temples, particularly of the recent past. It has a top quality management, which manages the temple on professional lines. On normal days you will find crowds entering through the main gates will be able to drive through almost till the main entrance to the temple. The temple is located over a hilly-land area of aprox 7-8 Acres, this was just another hill which was transformed into this amazing temple by the efforts of the temple committee. It incorporates a wonderful synthesis and fusion of traditional temple architecture with modern principles of construction and civil engineering. When you access the temple premises by foot, you will initially reach a footwear leaving place where you can deposit your footwear and walk further up to the actual temple environs. You will notice that most of the pathway is protected against rain and hot sun for those special days. You will soon be at the very entrance to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple where you will be faced with two options of going through the 108 rounded steps wherein you can enjoy the charm of reciting the Hare Krishna mahamantra on each step while waiting for the Queue to move forward, and this will be an enjoyable experience which is relished by many. Alternately, you can also by-pass this and use the other direct route, if you are short of time, wherein you can go to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple by the side route. When you enter the Sh. Laxmi Narasimha Swamy temple you will be struck by the awesome beauty and the amazing sculpture work of the main deity over here, you will want to stare at it to eternity and will be lost in spiritual ecstasy, however, life must move on and the crowds behind you would also want to have a glimpse of the Lord, and so they will usher you to the next temple. Do remember to pay your obeisance/worship to the Deities of Garudadeva and Shri. Hanuman on either side at the entrance of the Narasimha shrine. You will now be at the entrance of the Shri Srinivasa Govinda Temple where you will once again be mesmerized by the outstanding fineness and excellence of the sculpture work and you will feel as if you have been magically and suddenly tranlocated to Tirupati. After you enjoy the reverberations of Govinda, Govinda, you will now head to the main temple. The vast main hall on level 3 is accessed by wide steps with banisters and has a beautiful gold plated altar, with attractive interior designs and a ceiling with huge paintings, which are held together from the roof down, depicting the pastimes of Lord Krishna with His devotees. There is an all round internal balcony which gives a view of the temple sanctum sanctorum and this adds to the glamour and beauty of this place and also gives a birds eye view for the people during festivities when the crowds are spilling into the streets a kilometer or two long on occassions like Janmashtami etc. Everyday thousands of devotees from various parts of India and other countries visit the temple to seek the blessings of Their Lordships. At the main temple you will be bewitched by extraordinary beauty of The Presiding Deities in the temple Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Nitai Gauranga (Sri Nityananda Prabhu and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu). After having prayed to their lordships to your hearts content, remember to offer your respects to the most beautiful bronze sculpture of Srila Prabhupada who is peacefully witness to all the goings on in the temple and who guides the same by his divine presence. You will also see the endless rows of books by Srila and other devotees which are available for sale. If possible one should take this opportunity to contribute towards a life membership of ISKCON which will also feed millions of children in schools through the Akshaya Patre (endless supply of food, originally given by Lord Surya the Sun God to Yudhishtira, the Pandava King) program. While you allow all these things to soak into your mind and body, get back to Planet Earth and head towards the exit you will find lots of shops and sales points where every type of devotional stuff and vegetable eatery is available to satiate your taste buds, do check them out if you are in a hurry to move to the next location on your itinerary, otherwise head straight to the Higher Taste Restaurant in the same premises to eat like the Kings & his courtiers, see review separately for The Higher Taste Restaurant.",5,POSITIVE

But this is all until the main temple inside. Once you are done with the darshan, then enter the prasad/food junction, which is really crowded, and not well maintained. No management to handle the crowd there, people just rush through the food counters and the food is scrambled on floor, not cleaned etc. You'll lose the essence that you are in a temple that time. The parking is a big headache again, where in you have to walk to the other end of the temple after darshan, which is painful for elders. Lots of improvements required, and there is no feedback collection as well to suggest.",3,NEUTRAL

The rooms were very clean and each room opened out into an ""open space"" ( not a balcony) and this is something I really treasured. As an avid traveller, one sometimes feels clausterphobic in hotel rooms. Another amazing experience was from the food sold in the stalls ( within the hotel grounds).

I was made to feel very welcome and special even. There were hundreds of devotees there as well and the experience was very interesting and humbling as the people were clearly very devout and focused on their prayer.

The priests are very well-trained and well-'versed' (no pun intended). The food is strictly vegetarian and very tasty. The premises are very clean. The one MAJOR problem with the temple facility is that they're overly fussy about photography and do not allow even family events (such as weddings) to be photographed. I find that ridiculous, especially for such once-in-a-lifetime events of loved near-and-dear ones. Also, what harm could possibly occur when flash-less pictures are taken, of the temple and its premises?! The variety of goods that are available for sale in the temple is huge, and spectacular.

Ideally lot of people will get the intense feeling of temple atmosphere. other than that the temple is a nice place. The stalls in the exit way sells few of the handcrafted article and cloths. paintings and home decorative items.

One can buy the Bhagawad Gita by Swami Prabhupada translated into various regional languages. There is very tight security. The place is very cleanly maintained. Cameras are not allowed - but there are cloak rooms to leave your camera and collect them on the way out. A large number of steps need to be taken to reach the sanctum sanctorum - elderly people could find it difficult - but I think there are special darshan passes to avoid the steps (not sure - saw some signages about special darshan at extra cost).

Temple is closed between 1 pm to 4 pm. 2.Senior citizens can opt for lift facility . Wheel chairs available for physically challenged. 3.Paid Shuttle autos from entrance for those who can't walk ( not very sure. Ask the security or call temple. If you are coming by auto or uber you can ask them to drop up the hill they will allow without parking fee. If you have a private vehicle it's very good. Nevertheless it's a good exercise for people coming by metro or bus) 4. Direct exit for people not interested in shopping. There is a clear big LED board which shows direction for direct exit. Many people are complaining that you are forced into stalls. Nobody forces. There is an exit and you should just take that. 5. Buying books paraphernalia etc is optional. Again for those who feel it is a commercial shopping complex you can just take lift or walk away from counters. However their books are amazing and very inspiring. 6. Lot of books and things to engage school going kids into God consciousness. 7. Free meal everyday 11am to 2pm 8. Free Donna (cup) prasada of steaming hot kichidi. You can ask for any number they don't mind. 9. Weekdays you can have peaceful darshan for a longer time 10. You can buy tickets for a queue free closer darshan 11. Clean toilet facilities provided backside of temple 12. All prasadam ( pastries puffs) items are free of onion garlic and eggs obviously 13. Enquire about events in the temple like youth programs , summer camps etc. If you are interested. 14. On certain festivals like Narsimha jayanthi, panihati etc ( you can get to know thru their website about upcoming festivals) the evenings are marvellous. Must visit festival evenings at 6 30pm usually in the open air theatre. 15. Observe the way the Deities are decorated. I am sure no temple in Bangalore have such nice outfits and such decoration for deities that too EVERYDAY. 16. Car park, Guest house, Higher taste restaurant, animated movie Little Krishna shows, pooja paraphernalia, authentic books based on Scriptures, coloring books, kids books, school stuff, bakery... Many more. 17. If you donate even a rupee here, it is completely worth as they spend on free midday meals to school kids all over India. And their transactions are clear so you don't have to worry whether somebody is eating you money. They use all donations for seva of Lord. 18. Anybody can visit temple irrespective of race caste creed. No shorts allowed. U can rent dhoti.",5,POSITIVE

2136,Trip Advisor,Manjunath R,3/10/2017,Devine,"Beautifully architectures Temple - a combo of traditional and modern architecture, The temple is located on West Of Chord Road, Rajajinagar. ISKCON is a very popular destination accessible by Metro, Public transport, Auto,and Cabs, planing to take your car - well there is plenty of parking space. As you enter the huge and sprawling complex - Everything is organized very well. There is an orderly queue system - .after completing the mandatory security check, First you get a darshan of Lord Narasimha followed by a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara. Finally you climb to the top of the hill and enter the main temple to view Lord Krishna and Radha. The golden sanctum sanctorum, the marble flooring, the colorful paintings on the walls makes the darshan a great experience. After the darshan, there are many things to do in the temple complex - you can view a animation film on Krishna in the theater or you can visit the innumerable shops to buy the various products on sale - statues, photos, books and many other items. There are many food stalls and also a restaurant. You can even buy cakes (egg less of course). And before leaving you can favour the prasad, which is delicious. Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organized. A very important thing to note about ISKCON is its Akshay Patra scheme. ISKCON provides free food to lakhs of school going children as a part of the mid-day meal scheme. The maintenance of kitchen, the cleanliness, use of modern cooking technology and logistics is amazing. If you wish to be a donor or be part of any of their programs you can approach the temple authorities. If you are in Bangalore, make sure you visit ISKCON. You can easily spend a couple of hours in peace, getting the blessings of the Lord Krishna and also having a relaxing time. After the darshan of Lord Krishna and various other temple within the same complex, ISKCON also has vegetarian restaurant, the food served is Sathvik, a very good place for the vegetarians, seating arrangement is good (loved the sofas) and the service is satisfying, calm n peaceful ambience, with bhajans in the background, they have a very good variety in Buffet dinner starting from starters to deserts. The taste is good like I mentioned earlier service is at its best. They never haunt around you while eating but when you need them they will be in front of you very quickly. Overall, I definitely recommend this place and I have been a devotee of ISKCON for over 20 years now.",5,POSITIVE

I am still not sure if this place is free or no.. someone sold me a ticket for a prayer or a talk with one of the masters in the temple.

2225,Trip Advisor,Mike W,3/5/2017,Cognitive Dissonance,"There is a long entrance line where you can check your shoes and large bags (which are not allowed in the temple) and get a token to retrieve them later. You are required to wear appropriate clothing which includes having neither your shoulders nor legs visible. I had not done my due diligence and I showed up in shorts. After selling me a ticket for 500 rupees (apparently I needed a special access ticket different from most people), they told me they would supply me with appropriate garments. Sure enough after the luggage and shoe check and just before the entrance they rented me a wrap around to cover my legs. 20 rupees + 500 rupee refundable deposit. I appreciate that they had this available as I do wish to respect their place of worship. The people were all helpful and friendly, showing me how to tie the wrap around. It was odd being in a line and along a different path than 99% of the visitors. The special entry pass allowed viewing of 5 separate areas and participation in a short ceremony that included hand washing, touching of flowers and changing. It also included a couple of gifts including a yummy snack, a book written in Kannada and a box I haven't opened yet. From early on in my visit I had a strong feeling of cognitive dissonance. Later in more tour I have explicit issues I can identify that caused it but the feeling started before any of these. Specifically, after the main tour there is an area with signage explaining the Krishna religion. Two struck me, one was of a fish in a beach chair (labeled fish out of water), I definitely identified with that fish. Another explained how it was material things could not lead to happiness or clear thinking. After passing this area I passed through the most extensive set of gift shops, shopping areas and food sales I have ever seen in a religious institution. Towards the end the was an odd juxtaposition of signs for a paid lunch and others for a free lunch. At the very end they were offering a free bowl of some type of porridge. I feel I offended them by not accepting but by that point I was anxious to leave. This temple really is an outstanding piece of architecture and the people seemed genuinely friendly and helpful. YMMV.",2,POSITIVE

2227,Trip Advisor,MILIND_KOTKAR,6/4/2016,Perfect Mix of Tradition & Modernization,"The ISKCON temple is a must visit. It is visited by the locals and travelers and hence very crowded. You need to have atleast 2-3 hours for a good darshan and seeing the place minutely.There are quite a number of steps, however they are manageable for normal travelers. Private Cards can go upto a specific point. Better to avoid camera's as you have to keep them with authorities at a specific starting point. There is one toilet at the strting point and then directly at the exit point. Chappals also need to be stored with them, however it is done very systematically without any kind of problems. It is a great architectural work and you can also read the history while in the queue. The main idols are in the huge main hall called ""Hari Naam Kirtan"". As with each Iskcon temple, the idols are just beyond words. After the darshan, you can have many places to shop for souveniors, frames, bags, clothes, books, etc. Best time is to visit between 6 and 8.",5,POSITIVE

2229,Trip Advisor,Milson50,10/16/2014,ISKCON - a good experience for a westerner.,"I was escorted to the ISKCON temple by an Indian colleague while visiting Bangalore in July on business. To my eyes, this was an awe-inspiring place and to be honest quiet humbling. During my visit I seemed to be the only Christian westerner amongst a mass of Hindi Pilgrims and lots and lots of VERY smart schoolchildren, obviously taking a visit during term time ? these children seemed to take a great interest in me and were very polite and embraced the opportunity to speak to a guy from England - both, they and their parents and teachers should be proud of them. Its a very peaceful place and I even queued and did the 108 stepping stones with people chanting Hare rama Hare Krishna in each step. Once inside, it was again a beautiful place and the solid gold alter was adorned with flowers. As I say a very humbling experience. On exit - there is a large outlet selling souvenirs, a snack bar and restaurant. I was so pleased to be able to visit this great attraction and advise anyone from the UK or USA to do the same.

Hand and Leg washing facilities are provided at the entrance where your Bags and Footwear are supposed to be stored. Only visit this temple if you have at least 2-3 hours to spare. Amazing deity exhibitions and temple infrastructure.

You but cannot help to dwell into where your life is heading to in the rat race? This is a motivation enough for you to climb the staircase of the temple and what follows is but a fantastic date with God. The climb up to the temple sanctum sanctorum is a circuitous route and designed to heighten your sense of awareness and belonging with 'Him'. Though the place is fully commercialised yet you cannot miss his presence. Omnipresent. You can hear the chanting Hare Rama Hare Krishna all the way up and beyond. I strongly advise to sit with your eyes closed and feel him as you reach the sanctum. There will be pushing and hustling but the inner peace you experience post that is unimaginable. For the connoisseurs of satvic food there is a satvic hotel that will add to the mystism of your visit. All in all iskcon is one place in Bangalore that can pull you back to human roots.

2523,Google + HK HILL,Nishtha K,9/6/2016,Good experience for religious people but just okay if you are not religious,"I am not very religious in the sense that I am not one to worship too many idols and believe in rituals. I went to this temple purely as a tourist. I did not expect the visit to be so time-consuming; I mean, after all it is just a temple and if you do not sit down to pray and all, how long should it take. But I was wrong. They move inside the temple one step at a time on each ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" chant. This means that you take at least 20-25 minutes just to enter the temple. The temple is very beautiful and grand. The chants and music are very soothing and calms you down. The whole atmosphere is very enigmatic if you ignore the very in-your-face commercial aspect of the temple. (They are selling books and hoardes of other stuff - even the prasadam - at every corner). Overall a good experience but nothing worth remembering for very long.",3,MIXED

Its kept spic and span and the priests are also very nice and they are easy to talk to. My six year old son had questions about the golden interior work which they happily answered. Its little away from the main city so the travel time plus the visit there would require approx. 4 hours. they do have a canteen there where one can eat. the temple premises also has a restaurant with lunch buffet and Ala-crate options. Though, I feel it was overly priced at 750 per person since its on the temple premises and claims to offer Satvik food. Isckon Temple is one place I would definitely take my parents when they visit. the atmosphere is very peaceful and serene. I would have given it 5 points, however, there is one thing I kind of disliked is the packages they share for offering to God. the rate card is a put off.

There is sufficient parking, which is well handled by the security. The place is clean and well maintained. I have visited the place on multiple occasions- on one occasion we were fortunate enough to meet one of the priests who showed us the living quarters of the students who study there. The prayer hall is spacious and on most occasions there is enough space for one to sit in meditation or prayer, unlike in many other temples. At the exit there are multiple stalls/ shops selling souvenirs and Prasadam. The whole experience of climbing to the temple, praying and visiting he shops makes it a family outing for many!

To enjoy the scenario, I recommend walking up. In the steps up, you can have the darshan of Lord.Ganesha, Lord Narasimha , Lord Hanuman and Lord Balaji. Once you enter the main Lord Krishna hall, you really feel the vibe rations, your concentration increases and you are into different world. In spite of the big crowed the place is kept very clean.

Built on a hillock, it is the largest ISKCON temple built till date and is an architectural marvel.The temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna and His teachings and was built mainly by the efforts of Srila Prabhupada, founder of the ISKCON movement. Many festivals associated with Lord Vishnu and his avatars are celebrated here with aplomb. There is also a daily schedule of aarti and Gita recitation. I went with my parents to this temple when they visited Bangalore, and they loved the place. Usually there is always long queue to enter the temple. However, the place is well organised and the queue moves fast. By taking a bridge and a flight of stairs, you will reach the entrance of the main temple. The temple boasts of gold plated flagpost and kalash at the top. The environment of the main temple is serene and peaceful. There are idols of the deities - Radha, Krishna and Balrama. In the hall, there is place in the centre where the people can sit and absorb the surrounding. We sat for around 1 hour here. Once you have the darshan and pass along, you will find lits of stalls selling the puja items, books, idols and gift items. This will lead to the canteen, which is 100% veg and has very good items in the menu. There is also a restaurant if you go down. Prasadam is distributed outside, where you can see the lights also, if you happen to visit in the evening. A very good 3-4 hours can be spent here with adults, kids and young people.

Shoes need to be stored against a small fee and also if you carry bags and camera's this needs to be stored before you may enter the temple. Entrance is not free for tourists, but is worth to pay.

2659,Trip Advisor,peter_biber,8/20/2014,Nice temple but very commercialized,"The ISKON temple in Bangalore is still one of the must-see´s in the city. I personally like the temple because of its design, it is really awesome with how much effort this temple was built recently. However it really got more and more commercialized and I meanwhile feel the overdo the commerce inside of the temple. The temple is impressive, but the guys selling the books next to the are where the prayers are done disturb the procedure from my point of view. It is good to know that the money spent is used for the poor to provide poor kids with meals, but at the same time quite some amount is also used to built further impressive temples. If at the end this helps the poor it is fine. The gold statues inside are really impressive. If you go there as a foreigner, note that cameras inside are not allowed (once I was allowed to take it with me, once I had to leave it with the driver - so you need to have trust in your Rikshaw driver). Same applies for shoes, you either leave it outside of the temple or with the driver as inside people are only allowed to walk with bare foot. The temple even provides some free meal. Be cautious as it can be quite spicy. I usually buy some souvenirs or scents at the temple, things are reasonably priced, so there you do not get cheated and you can make a bargain on some items while supporting the temple and the poor. I would anybody also recommend to visit the Shiv Mandir temple next to the Leela Hotel on Old Airport Road. It provides a nicer spiritual experience. The Bull temple is nice as well (but much smaller and it does by far not provide the same spiritual experience as the Shiva Mandir or the ISKON) and somehow the guys there always try to rip me off.

However the 300 rupee entrance seemed to be paying for this and also a bag of Indian sweets/ biscuits and a free devotional book !I was prayed over and made to feel welcome despite being a woman visiting on her own. There are notices saying no photography or cameras and in fact my camera had to be left with security even though I would not have used it. as is normal in Hindu temples no shoes , but it is not clear where to leave them although there is in fact a large cloakroom for them. I f you get lost the ground can be scorching as you find your way - take socks. I accepted the free rice and tried to eat correctly but failed miserably. It felt rude to refuse. There are lots of things to buy but you do not have todo so and I never felt pressurised. I have seen similar goods in many western cathedrals. But.

ISKCON and Srila Prabhupad have done a great favour to humanity by establishing the Hare Krishna temples so that we may have an easy access to Lord Krishna.

Inside there are guards who will ask couples to sit apart and not face each other/ hold hands etc. Once you exit, the exit path is compulsorily through the commercial market/ complex which is just never-ending. Only after finishing your tour through the marketplace (right beneath the temple premises), you reach the prasad that is the famous ISKCON khichadi (that is the only nice part). Even if you are impressed by the temple n all, the market is a huge put off and spoils the mood instantly. This is the only ISKCON I have seen which has a such a huge market area.

A tip, leave your shoes in your car instead of leaving it in the repository as there are too many visitors and you risk losing your shoes or getting them mixed up, alternately you can stuff your shoes in your bag. Bring some wet ones to wipe off your dusty feet after the visit. The temple was majestic. Intricately designed all over. Going up the main staircase gave us a view of the lower parts of the temple, the roofs stunningly encased in gold! Inside the temple, we got to sit in the middle of a group of meditating and chanting visitors. Truly gave us a positive vibe.

The main temple is quite ornate with the golden alter, and many devotees sitting on the floor in the middle of the temple reciting the Hare Krishna mantra. Once you exit the main temple, you will enter the highly commercialize maze of marketplace stalls and food vending...seeming endless at times.

A great experience of spiritual, divine ambiance with the chanting of mantras and the Lord's darshan is hugely a blessing. .. Nethra darshan is a rare opportunity to the devotees to experience the Lord in our minds filled in divine submissions. ISKCON conducts every event and all the daily rituals in grandeur set in the atmosphere of strict adherence to the Aagama principles and punctuality is a standard perfection. The dedication seen in the alankaram of the Deities adorning the pleasing dresses is always a beautiful treat to our eyes and hearts on every occasion. Perfection in stich and fit is mesmerizing aspect and the tailor is greatly blessed to offer such services is a rarity. Prasadams offered to the Deities with great fervour and sanctity ensured in exclusive preparations in a secured environment and cleanliness of highest order. Devotees are equal in front of the Deities and the prayers are of soothing experience to the soul and one would forget the self while surrendering to the Lord totally with divinely attachments. The Akshaya Patra noon meal services, free Prasadams to every devotee after darshan and the Annadhana seva to the poor public are of highest quality and commitment in the minds of the Staff and volunteers.

Usually parking should not be a problem, esp on weekdays. But on weekends It can be a problem, esp whenever festivals are there. You might end up waiting for parking itself. There is a nominal fee for parking. The place can get very crowded during festival days. elders and people with health issues will find it difficult, as they will have to walk for sometime and will need to climb up some steps to get to the main temple.They do have some provision to reduce the number of steps, but cannot avoid that in entirety. The normal entrance is through a small room where you have 108 steps, and you chant ""Hare Rama hare Krishna krishna krishna hare hare"" as you make each step. The main temple have deities of Radha and Krishna. The sanctum sanctorum and deities are covered in gold. There will be always people who will be performing bhajans with musical instruments and you can sit there for some time. The place is highly commercialized, with lots of shops selling souvenirs, photos, vanity items etc...There are many eateries selling snacks and soft drinks. there is a Jain restaurant outside which serves Jain friendly food.

The moment u enter the temple's complex, there's a security check, no photography is allowed inside the temple. U will start chanting the Hare Krishna mantra before entering the main sanctum to pay respects to the beautiful Krishna, chanting is not compulsary however but u observe total silence and unconsciously u wld have chanted the mantra 108 times! Free prasad is given towards the end of your visit before you exit the temple. Lots of savoury and sweet snacks on sale too. Lots of souvenirs are also on sale. A beautiful temple to visit.",5,POSITIVE

Be that as it may it still conveys a sense of spirituality and the sacred energy. People do go there to pray and the temple runs a series of charity programs that support the needy. The temple itself is spectacular in it's size and decor, great frescoes of young Krishna line the walls and the statues are, as one would expect, beautiful. Worth a look, just try not to be too perturbed by the sales force.",4,MIXED

The journey to the temple from our home was however very long and time consuming in the traffics of Bangalore. But upon reaching the temple you would definitely be taken aback by its beauty and cleanliness. Everything is so organised in this temple right from the pathway, the stands for our footwears and the food and purchase stalls which comes after we have worshipped the lord Krishna. The main shrine is adorned with such beautiful ornaments and clothing making the entire scene a treat for our eyes. Also the repeated chants of Hard Krishna ... Hare Krishna...

The temple - Sanctum Sanctorum is very very neatly maintained and you have huge place to sit and do meditation or see the god. There is no time restriction for people who want to sit and feel the place. Once, you are out of the Sanctum-Sanctorum, you can find lots of shops selling fresh foods starting from sweets to samoza.

3231,Trip Advisor,Ria110494,6/6/2017,A Temple cum Mall,"This temple looked more like a small mall to me than a temple. As you enter you will have to undergo severe layers of checking and after that you have to climb many stairs to reach the main temple. Once you have had the darshan you will be made to walk through all the different stalls they have which became tiresome for my aged parents. You will also be given prasad after you finally come out of the temple. The main shrine is however beautiful and you can offer pushpanjali also by paying some amount. The time we went the temple was very crowded however the management was good and we did not face much issue. Also by buying some special darshan tickets you can opt for skipping the crowd. Another thing the temple had a dress code board on display which said ladies wearing only saree, salwar or kurti would be allowed in....however we found ladies wearing jeans also going (though they were few in number).....however one girl wearing three-fourth was stopped at the entrance.",4,NEUTRAL

However, its too commercialized for my taste. Maybe too flashy for my expectations of a temple. But if thats what you like then by all means, head there. I ate there as well, the food was too oily with too much spices, again not to my taste at all. I would expect a temple to be a bit more toned down, more peaceful and the food to be more ""satvik"" as promoted by the religion.

I would recommend the Visitor to visit it during non festive day if you are visiting alongwith your family which covers kids and older ones. Except this,if you are visiting alongwith your friends then you can visit on any day. The main sabhagruha of the temple is very big and one can sit for pray in between. One can find beautiful view of bangalore from it as it's on height. Two ways to enter in main sabhagruha: (1) By following usual queue (2) By paying extra fees- VIP entry Apart from this, one can buy different items such as pooja items, photos, frames, key-chains, t-shirts, kurtas, idols etc. of lord Krishna from here.

3272,Trip Advisor,Rohan P,8/15/2016,Most organized ISKCON temple in India,"One thing that strikes you, the moment you enter this temple is the enormity of the temple complex as well as the main temple size. You have to climb a lot of stairs to reach the main temple as well as pass through a couple of other smaller temples. The location of the temple is perfect. It is bang opposite the Sandal Soap factory and has become a landmark in itself. Close-by, you have the Orion Mall as well as the Sheraton Hotel. You have to pass through two security checks before you start the ascent to the temple. One at the entrance and the other after you deposit your bags and shoes. The entire system is very organized with volunteers and sevaks guiding you till you reach the top. The inner sanctum reverberates with the auspicious chants of ""Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare"". Listening to this chant, makes you feel at peace with yourself. After taking darshan of the Lord, you have to pass through a long route which is lined with the activities of the ISKCON group viz Books, Akshay Patra details etc. They also have a mini-theater which was showing animated films with respect to Lord Krishna. After darshan, you get prasadam which is generally a rice-based hot khicdi. Keep in mind that you will be allowed entry only if you are dressed in proper clothing. No shorts/three-fourths allowed for gents. Overall, you may spend approximately one hour in the temple premises with delays only during peak times like evening aartis.",4,POSITIVE

The religious rituals probably are missing. A few contradictory activities ( onions as prasadhams), keeping God as a show idle etc., does not create a feeling of a place of worship. At times, fear of God controls our behaviour, makes us disciplined. I would call it more a religious place than a temple- if we compare it with Thirupathi balaji temple or the Mahalakshmi Layout Anjeneya Temple which is just opposite ISKON.",3,NEGATIVE

3346,Google + HK HILL,Safesafari,5/24/2017,Spirituality with a tad of commercialism,We visited the temple on a rainy evening. What stands out first is the nearly organised car parking. The entire temple complex is a series of vegetarian food shops on the ground floor...Ranging from over the counter snack shops to exorbitantly priced fine dining. Start climbing the stairs and you will be impressed with the semi modern architecture. Also the queues are efficiently organised and within 15 minutes you are in the main hall. The main hall is grand. A huge capola with frescos from the life of Krishna will keep you mesmerised till you reach the main shrine. For Rs. 150 per family you can break off from the regular line and get a family Darshan right in front of the deity. The way back winds through a series of outsourced counters where vendors try and sell you just about anything with branding of Krishna on the goods. That kills the euphoria and spirituality you felt a few moments back. TIP : The samosas stall on the way out has a good fare.,4,NEGATIVE

Add to it the chants of Lord's glory echoing through the huge hall having beautiful murals depicting the pass times of Krishna. Seems as if it's real or everything is a passing dream not to be woken up. Pure bliss. One can buy the special darshan tickets for group of 4 or 6 person, which entitles speedy darshan including at Narasimha, Balaji and finally the Radha Krishna along with Nitai Gauranga and Krishna Balarama in main temple, by passing the queues. This pass also gives privilege to offer prayers (archana) and take prasads and books. However I would recommend going in normal queue, which gives the privilege of chanting ""Hare Krishna"" mantra 108 times with other devotees as one climbs to the temple. Everyone is served a bowl of prasad at the exit and on Sundays it's lunch (satvik and tasty). However there are many snack items available just before the exit one can buy, like samosa, kachori, rasagola, gulab jamuns, pizza slices, burgers, sandwiches, juice. Souvenir shops aplenty to satiate your yearnings to keep memories of visiting ISKON at Bangalore.

First thing first, they have ample parking so no need to worry - one has to somehow reach beating traffic in Bangalore. The way they have constructed four temples (one above the other) is a visual treat. The main temple has a lot of place to sit and enjoy the spiritual music. What follows after darshan is something many people may not like but I was fine. First, one has to necessarily go through all the spiritual / book stalls and then one will see a lot of food on sale. It is like a mall in my opinion. The only complain i have is the temple authorities should mention at the top itself the free food is served at the very end. What really happens is people get excited after looking at a lot of food options and they end up eating after which they have no appetite to enjoy the deliciously free meals.

Entrance to the temple is free but they also have a ""special entry pass"" for 300INR. Not sure if that was only because it was Independence Day (August 15) or if they always have that. Anyway, what's good about the pass, especially if you're a tourist in a hurry, is you get to bypass the queue of devotees. When we were there, it was full house so the special entry pass gave us our space and we got to walk according to our pace. I hope that made sense.

After queuing up in a dated, cramped, fenced off area, once you are through to go in, you pay to put your shoes away, bags away, and I even ended up having to pay a refundable deposit for a shawl to cover my legs up (don't wear shorts, or skirts without something to cover your legs when visiting), plus a further few rupees to cover laundry costs. Once inside, you are rushed through in order to keep the queues flowing. A priest blessed those who offered donation, but abruptly stopped when he felt more donations were required. Once inside the main temple, you are offered the chance to get to the front for a fee. Otherwise you continue to queue at a distance and be ushered through and told to keep moving along. Once you have visited, you are led out through an endless gift shop, which seems bigger than the temple! Prasad was free (!) and generous however.

With this special entry you can walk through all levels easily with no line up. I recommend to pay the special entry, at each level your entrance will be much more easier and you get closer to the scene as well. At the end you get a few gifts from the temple. 3- Far from the Bangalore center. But if you are planning to go to the Orion mall then it is a good plan to visit this place and then go to the mall which is close to the temple. 4- I couldn't have a nice view to the façade because of some constructions was going on. So somehow I missed the nice view of the temple. 5- it is a culture place as well, like many other places in India. Also they provide free food to those in need. However at some point I felt it is like a shopping mall just to make money. 6- The whole path and the system to follow up going step by step to the top floor is interesting, but wasn't amazing for me. 7- They are well organized.",3,MIXED

Inside there is a Radha-krishna mini temples and a major hall in which these dieties are kept. Huge gatherings of people sit in this hall while the pooja is being done. surrounding it are the stalls to sell books by swamis and other souveniers to keep post the visit. there are passages within the temple that opens up to stalls selling various religious items.

Not aware of its height and so much zig zag lines even for shoes . And that's for that morning when there was not a single person to visit.no rush no people. There can be short cut way to enter the temple when there is no one , like in airports when there is rush on a particular day they stretch the lines in a zigzag long way .but when there is no rush they cut short. We are senior citizens and heart patients but not the security told us ,not any sign of lift there.we were so much exhausted in climbing three floors height long long paths .after reaching so much height we asked some one there about any other way to go down then he told yes there is a lift there. We were very much surprised and felt bad of their carelessness for not thinking of devotees. These stairs and long paths should be used only on festivals. I request the management to take care of these comforts to public. http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d325162-r320985441-ISKCON_Sri_Radha_Krishna_Chandra_Temple-Bengaluru_Bangalore_Karnataka.html#",3,NEGATIVE

3898,Trip Advisor,Srikanth H,9/22/2015,?Very clean?,"A very well maintained place. I am not a religious person at all and I went here with my family because I had heard so much about this place and it happened to be close to where we were staying and we had a whole day with nothing else to do and so we decided to give this place a try. And I'm glad that I did. After a few minutes in this place something started bothering me, something that was not quite what you would expect in a temple and I couldn't put my finger on it. And then it hit me! This place is CLEAN! And no SMELL!! No beggars at the entrance!!! The cleanliness is something that you do not associate with temples usually. There, I have said it. Sad, but true. Let us face the truth....temples are not very clean because you usually see rotting fruits, coconuts and flowers being thrown around and temples usually have a peculiar but unique smell (like our railway stations. You can smell a railway station before you reach it). ISKCON is squeaky clean and only has a pleasant smell. That is a big plus in my book. There is a constant, repetitive, droning chant going on over the discreetly placed public address system. You can not escape it. It follows you everywhere like Mary's little lamb. If you like such things, you'll find it quite peaceful and divine. For me it got old in a hurry and started driving me a little crazy after an hour or so. Well, that's just my opinion. You may find the droning voice quite soothing. They have a big area selling some nice posters, statuettes, lovely T shirts and other trinkets. There is a big walk-around restaurant where they sell very good, tasty meal for a very reasonable price. This place was not that clean but I think you should blame it on the people who visit and not the management. Even though there are many dustbins some people were dumping their plates where they stood and not in the bins. But I think we will learn to keep our public places clean very soon. Like in a million years. I mean, what is the big hurry? As you leave, they give you prasadam which is quite tasty. They give it in a disposable cup and again our people just eat and dump those cups all over the place except in the dustbins. Only these two areas are not so clean (even though the employees/volunteers keep picking up the discarded food plates). Give this place a try. You will need at least 2-3 hours inside.",4,MIXED

I would rate this as a tourist attraction, rather than a temple.. People come to visit it, as most of the tour operators take them as first place to visit in Bangalore.. Nice and well maintained..

So if any of my statements offend someone, my most sincere apologise in advance as if at all, it is unintentional. I have had varied experiences over the years. I have visited this temple from the year 1990 during which it has gone through radical transformation. In the 90s, this used to be a calm lovely place (well which place of Bangalore wasn't!!!) and mostly simplistic which had its serenity about it and a sense of spiritual charge. The reconstruction of the grand temple which stands today has chaged the dynamic of the place for me. It stands tall in structure and imposing in presence, but somehow seems more commercial like most temples in India are turning into. I understand the need to generate revenue for the upkeep, but the diversification into associated businesses seems to be dliuting the spiritual feel of this place as many others. Walking through the sales counters at the end of the circuit feels a bit busy and untemple like. more than a few people come there just to snack and hangout, which is all well, but also contributes to the place feeling like a mall with a temple in there. On another visit my wife was pulled outside the line to be told that she should buy a book for her salvation. This could be an isolated incident by an overenthusiastic volunteer, but it was quite forceful and therefore unpleasant. This also probably happened as she is not Indian. She is fully appreciative of India and its vibrance and follows her understanding of the Hindu principles but she felt forcefully targetted. But it is worth a visit and it still has its nice side. My review is more of what doesnt seem right. So go visit and write your positive experiences.",3,MIXED

It was a Saturday and I had visitors from another country interested in going to ISKCON so we planned and left Koramangala at 11.00am. By the time we reached the location it was nearing 2.30pm. I would blame this time laps on weekend rush. Then we went in to the temple from one side after buying the tickets. The structure was plain white.

We took the tour and I tried to absorb as much as i can but frankly speaking I was just waiting to leave due to the crowd. we finally managed to reach the place where they serve food.

After that they will propose to you various kind of membership to ISCKON which the cost ranges from INR50,000 to 1 lakh. If you not interested then they will ask for donation.

I am not religious, but I am spiritual and enjoyed participating. It was unique compared to the other temples I visited. I think everyone should visit this place. The things I didn't like: because you're basically in a single-file line the whole time, you can't really stand around and just soak everything in and appreciate the shrines and stuff. You gotta keep moving. The other thing that is a huge turn off, is it seems like a business- as soon as you make your way through and get to the big room at the top, they have floors of stalls and tables and people aggressively trying to sell you things. I did buy a CD of the chanting, and it is beautiful and was super cheap. But it was frustrating to be in such a beautiful temple and feel that the experience was tainted by the business-like approach to the people there.

The temple is very clean and ofcourse no photos are allowed inside the temple. The visual of the Lord Krishna's idol and the decor is simple amazing and breath taking. After the 'darshan', the queue ends up at commercial stalls lined up to sell prasad/books/clothes/food and accessories.

A word of warning about dress code - my shorts were cut just above the knee, and that meant I had to hire a skirt before I could go in. Not a particularly good look - you have been warned!

Inside you would make you way through a series of plateau where you will see different deities as you make you way up. The building and surrounding is so clean and nice with marble / granit flooring everywhere. The main building is the top where you will find deities of Krishna .

There are beautiful painting from the Bhagwatgita and you can spend time admiring these or in contemplation. Once you leave the space and get to the exit, you are unfortunately hit by a relentless array of shopping and food, which I felt was a little too excessive; but the fact that the funds are generated for the upkeep and the numerous charity projects, is probably a reasonable reason to excuse the same.

4439,Trip Advisor,Vikram S,3/2/2016,Very religious place,"ISKCON was founded by Prahalad prabhupada, from Calcutta whom decided to spread Krishna's words. It is a very religious place, with many rules and very little freedom to experiment one's individual spirituality. At the entrance you will find devotees promoting Pooja coupons and trying to sell offerings for Krishna, as well as cloak rooms to leave the camera and other bags. There's a lot of security checking and guards which are quite strict... All this sort of kills the enchantment of the place... But I guess its still interesting to see the shrine. After the Pooja, visitors and devotees receive 'prasadam' in a leaf cup. And at the exit, you will find plenty of opportunities to buy gadgets, souvenirs, sweets, books. There are different shrines dedicated to Radha and Krishna. The main temple with the golden shrine has ceiling paintings with Krishna's childhood events.

Metro station (Soap Factory) makes accessibility easy. 2. Hill Top temple. Built on a hillock, it gives you an ethereal experience climbing the stairs to reach the temple. 3. Temple: With chants of lord krishna reverberating in the background, its a peacueful experience to visit the yoganarasimha and balaji temple on your way up the hill to the main Krishna temple. The main Krishna Temple is huge hall with golden idols. Awe inspiring, peaceful. 4. Krishna memorabilia: on your way out of the temple, you get an opportunity to purchase Krishna theme products : books, collectables shirts etc. 5. Free Prasad: They provide free Prasad of Pongal ( Khichri) which is very good. They also distribute free lunch prasad coupons 6. Restaurants: They have a premium restaurant in the temple complex which was closed when we visited. You also have an option of going to their dining hall and having a basic meal of Rs 75 ( rice sambhar sabji and papad). There is another small restaurant where you can get Poori Bhaji and a rice dish. 7. Parking: Adequate parking space for 4 wheelers at Rs 30 8.

This time when I visit Bengaluru, Bengaluru has several gems in its crown and ISKCON temple indeed deserves a central attention place. It's an admirably treat for eyes for devotees and tourists alike. Beautifully crafted architecture and design, craftsmanship, Grand Idols of RadhaKrishna & ors. Maybe you have seen lots of other ISKCON temples in other parts of India and probably all appear same. Even then if you are in Bengaluru, don't miss ISKCON. Give it one hour minimum, if you can. Krishna is going to be a nice experience and feel. Please Don't opt for special Darshanam. Move as a common simple man and enjoy Krishna's Consciousness in everyone you see, then, may be for a split second, you may feel it is Krishna Consciousness in you too. In case you want to offer any puja etc then you may buy the same at prescribed counter by tendering prescribed amount and obtain a receipt. Besides devotional feature, equal emphasis is on Marketing feature. You can Sell God in India. Incredible India it is. May be our great seers like Swami Prabhupad or Acharya Rajneesh never even wildly imagined in their life times that they themselves are Saint Peter of Today's Vatican. But one thing whatsoever they sell, let it be books, audio, idols, souvenirs, every piece is beautifully crafted and produced. You will not regret for quality of products. There is a free kitchen besides other selling points for a variety of delicacies of India. The kitchen provides free food to whosoever comes to eat and trust me the food is simply delicious. Here in this complex, I fear one of the big shortcoming is parking. Lots and lots of tourists visit and parking space for vehicles is going to be a big issue, if not attended in time.

The family consists of strong believers, not so 'strong' ones, moderately devout and pure touristas! ( as all families consist!) But all of us enjoyed the outing . There are elaborate arrangements for storage of your footwear and an ingenious system for washing the feet of the devotees as you walk in... The architectural marvel is right in the heart of the city. For the devout, there is definitely the ""presence"" the ambiance of the Supreme Being, amidst all the hustle and bustle of the crowd and the some-what un-subtle commercialization. If you are going because you are a firm devotee, please select a less crowded time like early mornings or afternoons, certainly not evenings in the week end.. There is a separate circuit for the believers, where you move from step to step chanting the prayer, which is moving and thought provoking, if you have the time. Don't get into that loop if you are there for a quick dekko and exit. There is a VIP darshan, which is not fair to the regular devotees, but alas, a fact of life. Also the commercialization could be made a bit more unobtrusive..... Otherwise we really soaked up the atmosphere and the magnificence and opulence of the deities.

People are encouraged to buy ""paid darshan"" - but it is not required and most of the times - queue in ""free darshan"" is very small.

Do not eat anything in the canteen or buy any stuff from the temple stores as they are not of very high quality and are usually overpriced. For example I bought some sweets for prasadam and I hoped that since they are made in this special place they must be very pure and good. But I found out opposite. Did not get a very good feel. I also tried the breakfast they serve in the canteen, it is not up to the mark, not at all :( However, I must say that the prasadam (free) you get near the exit, is really really good :) I do not really condemn the business model a lot because this money is eventually used for good purposes like Akshay patra program etc (as far as I know).

There is a special darshan for people who can pay cash of Rs 500, which is atrocious. The entry to the temple is regulated at every point and it does not give a good feeling at all.

4591,Trip Advisor,winner2312,9/13/2013,Beautiful temple,"The temple is characterized by a combination of old and new. Thus, the whole area is very interesting. We were there one afternoon a week and were the only foreigners. The temple one can only enter barefoot. The shoes are made in advance. Similarly, you may release large pockets and the camera. Here we were skeptical at first, but once you go through the process once, the delivery of valuables is safer here than in other areas where you must include the valuables. Officially, one may take any photos in the plant. There are but few overseers, so you can make relatively good photos from your phone.",5,POSITIVE

With intricate layout, a flight of steps that opens to a huge hall that sings glories of Krishna and Radha, it makes one go wow in wonder. the roof panels are painted with gigantic images from Krishna's life. Prasadam is available in the form of a hundred different snacks from cakes to samosas.
